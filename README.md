# Automating F1 Analysis using Python

## F1 Data Analysis

This project analyzes various datasets related to Formula 1 racing, including circuits, results, driver standings, and more.

Data for analysis is taken from [Kaggle - Formula 1 World Championship (1950-2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/data)

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the Jupyter notebooks, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3
- pip (Python package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, plotly, bokeh

## Installation

Run this in terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install notebook
sudo apt install jupyter-notebook
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn folium plotly bokeh
jupyter notebook # to start the Jupyter notebook
```

## Output 
I have attached some outputs for your reference.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my deep gratitude to Rohan Rao (Vopani), whose comprehensive Formula 1 World Championship dataset has been instrumental in the success of this project. His meticulous work in compiling the dataset and making it publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/data) has provided invaluable data that enabled thorough analyses and insights into the world of Formula 1 racing.

The dataset's detailed records of races, drivers, constructors, and results from 1950 to 2020 have been a rich source of information that has greatly enhanced the depth and accuracy of this project. I highly recommend it to any enthusiasts or professionals interested in analyzing Formula 1 data.
